    "#     First and foremost the exploration tool should be used to fetch and return additional components of information\n",
    "#     relevant to the selections that the existing visualiztion generates. For example, if a user requests top occupations\n",
    "#     within a Career Area, and one of those occupations seems to need more context, the user can rely on the exploration \n",
    "#     tool to deliver interesting and relevant data on that occupation to help the user understand why the visualization\n",
    "#     looks as it does. An emperical example from our research so far comes from the occupation \"Research Associate\"\n",
    "#     generating a significant ammount of jobs that ask for maintinence and repair; by using the exploration tool to search\n",
    "#     job titles or expand skill names, the user comes to understand that that skill request is actually relevant to \n",
    "#     managing sophisticated scientific equipment. As of now this tool can only access the data within the main_table but\n",
    "#     in the future we would expect that all available data columns would be available to the user to explore. In the \n",
    "#     short run, however, we will have to omit the salary and geography based data for confidentiality reasons. \n",
    "#     It is important that the tool is agnostic to what the user might want to retrieve from the visualization. The tool \n",
    "#     will make the user aware of the available options and axes in which they can dig deeper into the available subset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Design goals:\n",
    "#     We would like the user to be able to re-run the exploration tool if the bucket they have returned to them ends\n",
    "#     up being too large in size. This of course would mean that the tool would need to somehow store the current \n",
    "#     filters and states. We assume that it would be fastest and easiest to have a tool that can branch from existing \n",
    "#     visualizations, since each of these narrow down and structure the data. However, ideally the long run goal such a \n",
    "#     tool would be to allow the user to begin exploration from scratch with the entire 4 million postings.\n",

    "# User Experience:\n",
    "#     In terms of UX we have developed a command line here for its simplicity and ease of implimentation for proof of concept,\n",
